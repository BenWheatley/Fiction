# Fiction

A general repo for short fiction.

The copyright licence may vary by file (especially as I intend to use this repo to add fiction in shared settings which may have their own licences). If I forget to add an explicit copyright notice, assume the legal default of copyright laws — i.e. that you can't do anything unless you get written permission from me — and also message me to let me know I forgot to add it.

* [Death Star](Death%20Star/Death%20Star.md): An alternative timeline in the [Deathworlders](https://deathworlders.com) series, set immediately after the Hunters make Alpha Centauri explode.
* [Homo Capara](Homo%20Capra/Homo_Capara.html): An alternative reality where there is a goat-like human subspecies, done in the style of a Wikipedia article. Mostly generated by AI, minimal editing by me for formatting, repeated promting and plenty of cherry picking to make sure it keeps to the fictional reality and doesn't start veering into "this hypothetical creature" or "look what nonsense ye olde people used to belive in"
