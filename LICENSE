The copyright licence may vary by file (especially as I intend to use this repo to add fiction in shared settings which may have their own licences).

If I forget to add an explicit copyright notice, assume the legal default of copyright laws — i.e. that you can't do anything unless you get written permission from me — and also message me to let me know I forgot to add it.
