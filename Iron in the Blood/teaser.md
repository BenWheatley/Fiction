# Iron in the Blood

Lt. Colonel Mara Jansen squinted through her helmet visor, the display flickering with static as the sandstorm intensified. The storm had descended suddenly—an alien phenomenon that seemed like a curse from the gods of this unforgiving planet, Varos. Dark, jagged rocks stretched across the horizon, battered by lightning that slashed the sky. Her team crouched low in the rocky outcroppings, waiting for her signal.

“Jansen, they're moving,” said Sergeant Durek, his voice a low growl in her earpiece. The big man had a voice like gravel, but he was right—their targets were advancing. From their perch, they could see the Y’rathi swarms shifting in the distance, a mass of insect-like bodies writhing with unnatural precision.

“Hold,” Mara commanded, her eyes narrowing. Timing was everything. Humanity had never been the most powerful force in the galaxy—far from it. But they were the most stubborn. And, right now, stubborn was the only thing keeping them alive.

The Y’rathi were advancing on the coalition base, a makeshift collection of high-tech shelters dug into the cliffs below. Alien defense turrets hummed, preparing for the onslaught, but Mara knew they wouldn’t hold long against the hive. The coalition had been wrong about this war from the start. They’d tried to fight the Y’rathi with careful precision, relying on their advanced tech and centuries of protocol. They hadn’t expected the sheer savagery of a species born to consume, adapt, and evolve through destruction.

But Mara had. Humanity had learned the hard way, through millennia of war and survival on Earth’s harsh environments. They didn’t win because they were smarter or stronger than their enemies. They won because they fought dirty, thought laterally, and refused to back down.

“They're close enough now,” Mara said, her tone even. “Activate the charges.”

With a grim smile, Durek tapped his wristpad, and beneath the ground, the explosives they’d planted earlier roared to life. Massive chunks of rock tumbled from the cliffs, smashing into the advancing Y’rathi forces, crushing dozens in seconds. The terrain itself had become their weapon.

“Move!” Mara barked, and her squad launched into action. They slipped down the rocky slope like shadows, their armor blending into the storm-wracked landscape. The Y’rathi were scrambling now, trying to reform their ranks, but it was chaos.

As they reached the bottom, Mara spotted their coalition allies emerging from their shelters—tall, regal K’thar soldiers in their gleaming armor, hesitating. They weren’t used to this kind of warfare. They’d trained for clean, honorable combat, not the dirty guerrilla tactics humanity thrived on.

“Jansen,” a voice crackled through her comms, breaking the brief silence. It was Dahkor Vane, the K’thar diplomat attached to her unit, who had insisted on staying in the thick of it, despite his people’s disdain for direct combat.

“Colonel, this is madness,” Vane protested. “We’re exposing ourselves too soon.”

Mara ignored him. The Y’rathi were already regrouping, their hive mind working faster than any species she had ever encountered. If they didn’t hit hard now, they wouldn’t get another chance.

“Harper, I need that gas grenade ready,” she snapped, turning to Dr. Ian Harper, their team’s xenobiologist, who had just finished rigging up one of his experimental concoctions. They had found a weakness—barely. The Y’rathi were impervious to most weapons, but Harper’s research had revealed that a specific cocktail of Earth microbes, combined with the planet’s atmosphere, could wreak havoc on their biology.

“Ready to blow,” Harper said, holding up the makeshift grenade. His usually calm demeanor was a bit strained, but he trusted Mara’s plan—he always did.

“Launch it,” she said, and he did.

The grenade arced through the air, spinning end over end, before landing in the midst of the Y’rathi swarm. It hissed open, releasing a cloud of noxious, green-tinged gas that spread fast, engulfing the front lines.

At first, nothing. Then, the Y’rathi began to writhe, their segmented limbs flailing as the microbial toxin took effect. Some collapsed entirely, their bodies liquefying into dark pools of ichor.

“That’ll buy us time,” Mara muttered, watching the aliens falter. But she knew it wouldn’t last. The Y’rathi were relentless, adapting at an impossible speed. Soon, they’d be immune to the gas, and they’d come back stronger.

Still, time was all she needed.

“Fall back to the ridge!” she ordered, her voice cutting through the comms. “We need to regroup and hit them again before they adapt.”

Her team moved like a well-oiled machine, retreating in tight formation up the ridge. Behind them, the coalition forces began to follow, more hesitant but learning quickly from the humans’ example.

Dahkor Vane, now at her side, glanced at her with what could almost be respect in his alien eyes. “Your people fight like madmen,” he said. “But... it works.”

Mara smirked. “It’s called thinking outside the box, Dahkor. You should try it sometime.”

They reached the ridge just as the Y’rathi began to recover, their hive mind reforming in the distance. The swarms were already shifting, adapting to the gas, but Mara wasn’t worried. She had a dozen more tricks up her sleeve.

“We hit them again,” she said to her team, her gaze never leaving the approaching enemy. “And again. Until they’re nothing but dust.”

And with that, they prepared to launch their next assault—humans and aliens, side by side, facing an enemy that seemed unstoppable. But Mara Jansen knew better. The Y’rathi might have evolved to consume everything in their path, but humans? They’d evolved to endure.

And in this war, that was all that mattered.
